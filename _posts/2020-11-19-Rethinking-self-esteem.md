I've run into the problem of getting older, as a side effect I've accumulated a lot of unfinished projects. A lot of dreams unfilfilled.

A big reason I feel down on myself is the number of things I've tried and not stuck with, some of which I'm still paying off debt for.

It's lead to feeling that I've never really mastered any skill, except my ability to acrue materials and unfinished projects. Those debts make me even wary of investing in anything new, for fear I make the mistake of another bad investment.

But isn't it so funny, that my sense of self worth, my feeling of pride, is all tied into what I have or haven't accomplished?

What asshole decided this was a good idea? [a future topic]

I wonder what it look like to decouple this accomplishment drive from my self-esteem!

What does self-esteem look like without capitalism to guide it?

No quick answers came to me, but it's worthy of brainstorming. So let's get to it!

1. Maybe self-esteem could come from a sense of resiliency, having survived to this point, and somehow still surviving.

2. Maybe self-esteem could be an unsassailable right, needing no foundation, but acting as the foundation for our actions and beliefs.

3. Maybe self-esteem could come from breadth, not depth. It could be the accumulation of multitudes of fun little experiences.

Maybe self-esteem could be something completely different.


### Closing thoughts:

> Saddling accomplishment, a win/lose dynamic, with self-esteem seems so risky. If I gain failures at a rate faster than I can achieve successes, I'll never be able to catch up, and it becomes a losing game. This all assumes that failures are plenty, successes are few, failures are bad, and successes are good.

> Which is funny, because when I've finished a project I'm proud of, it's the finishing that is the most depressing part.
