title: Your habits can drown out your desires

I had the habit of playing video games. I still want to, but I'm not letting myself. It got in the way of living, and it drowned out my actual desires. It made me into a person I didn't want to be, but I didn't have the awareness of who I had become.

So I've stopped, for now. I can't promise I'll be done for good, but I need to make space for my dreams. 

The funny thing is that I have a hard time thinking what my dreams are. The habits I had got so loud I couldn't even tell what my dreams were.

I still just want to live a habit filled life. It sounds so easy, even if it isn't filling. It's a mac and cheese existence.

So I'm in that in-between place, where I've stopped my habits, but I don't know what's next. It's an uncomfortable place.

Thank god I'm stubborn enough to remain here until a dream arrives. I'm going to try to listen real hard, be curious, and stay quiet.

Wish me luck.
