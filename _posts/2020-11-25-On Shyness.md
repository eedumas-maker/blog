One of the many reasons I feel shy and afraid to share is my belief that we don’t need any more white guys who think their ideas are hot shit. And somehow, by me staying silent, I’m helping by not becoming one of those guys. It's silly, but I'll explain.

I know that going from Silent Social Isolate to Pompous Loud Jackass entails a lot more than sharing a few words, but it feels that way to me. I remember being a quiet teen writing a few poems that somehow got noticed, only to hammer out tons upon tons of awful verse just because that little hit of attention was so addicting. I was no longer writing for myself, but for my insecurity. I believe nothing has caused more damage than white male insecurity and I know I’m not immune to it (this post being evidence enough).

How would I even know if what I’m saying is valuable? I can never be sure if folks are listening to me because my words have merit, or because a confident-appearing white guy with an ounce of vulnerability fits into some cultural role they need in order to think all is well with the world. If I feel confident enough to share how would I even know if that wasn’t born from a subconscious entitlement to be heard, an unearned privilege?

Now being asked to share is different. A listener giving consent to having me speak lets me relax, open up and say my peace.  There’s so much less risk. A blank page, an unposted draft, an idea on a notebook, they don’t have anyone’s permission except my own, and that doesn’t feel good enough. It’s all too easy to shoot down ideas before they get a chance to grow. 

What I’ve thought has no doubt been thought and shared before, so me adding my own voice would only expose how little I’ve read on the topic. I ought to know which giant’s shoulders I’d be standing on. Even these arguments against writing don’t feel new, but a foundational challenge for writing in general. 

### Closing Thoughts:
> It makes me curious how writers get anything done, if they have some secret to their courage. Maybe they experience all of this and take off writing anyways. 

> Maybe we’re all potential writers. We just don’t know how to clear the runway yet.
