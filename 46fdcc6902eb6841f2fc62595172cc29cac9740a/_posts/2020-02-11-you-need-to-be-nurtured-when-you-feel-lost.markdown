title: You need to be nurtured when you feel lost

Sometimes I feel lost. I know I need to STOP (Stop Think Observe Plan). But I often forget that I need to care for myself. Stopping lacks the reminder that we all need to be nurtured. We need to have our fears acknowledged and assuaged. We need comfort when we're uncomfortable, and I can't think of anything more uncomfortable than feeling lost. 

The good news is that this nurturing, this compassion, can come from you. This is a time to find that caring voice inside you, or if you're new to it, make one up. A voice that will give you hope. A voice that reminds you why you're on your journey. A voice that helps you find meaning for any suffering you're experiencing.

Often this voice will tell you that "all of this is temporary," or "you're on the right path," or "you got this." 

We need this voice. We can have this voice. It will take practice, but deep down I believe we all have the capacity to hear our kind nurturing voice.

Go ahead, listen to a part of yourself that isn't afraid. It's there and wants to be heard.
