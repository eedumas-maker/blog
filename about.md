Hi there, 

My name is Evan Dumas, and you've found my place to put words. Before this I've mostly written in my notebooks, with the rare exception being a few printed zines (small booklets). 

This blog exists for me to write nice things to myself, and hopefully if you're reading this it means I've decided to be vulnerable and share it.

When I'm not writing you can find me working from home or occasionally giving talks on how to be nice to ourselves. It's an ongoing practice.

Thank you for reading,
Evan
